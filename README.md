Project Summary: Credit Fraud - Dealing with Imbalanced Datasets
Simple Explanation:
In this project, you worked on a dataset related to credit card transactions. The main challenge was that the dataset was imbalanced, meaning there were a lot more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones. This is a common issue in fraud detection because fraudulent transactions are rare but critical to identify.

You used different techniques to handle this imbalance and improve the model's ability to detect fraud. These techniques might include methods like:

Resampling Techniques: Adjusting the dataset so that fraudulent and legitimate transactions are more balanced.
Specialized Algorithms: Using algorithms that are better at handling imbalanced data.
Performance Metrics: Choosing the right metrics to evaluate the model, focusing on correctly identifying fraud even if it means making some mistakes on legitimate transactions.
The goal was to build a model that could accurately identify fraudulent transactions without being overwhelmed by the larger number of legitimate ones.
